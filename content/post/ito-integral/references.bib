	abstract = {Uncertainties in velocity data are often ignored when computing
	            Lagrangian particle trajectories of fluids. Modelling these as
	            noise in the velocity field leads to a random deviation from each
	            trajectory. This deviation is examined within the context of small
	            (multiplicative) stochasticity applying to a two-dimensional
	            unsteady flow operating over a finite-time. These assumptions are
	            motivated precisely by standard availability expectations of
	            realistic velocity data. Explicit expressions for the deviation's
	            expected size and anisotropy are obtained using an It√¥ calculus
	            approach, thereby characterizing the uncertainty in the Lagrangian
	            trajectory's final location with respect to lengthscale and
	            direction. These provide a practical methodology for ascribing
	            spatially nonuniform uncertainties to predictions of flows, and new
	            tools for extracting fluid regions which remain robust under
	            velocity fluctuations.},
