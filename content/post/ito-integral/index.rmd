## An example


## Itô integrals in my research

One way @balasuriya [@balasuriya_stochastic_2020] to model this uncertainty is via a stochastic differential equation of the form 
$$ 
\mathrm{d}y_t = u(y_t, t)\mathrm{d}t + \varepsilon\sigma(y_t, t)\mathrm{d}W_t,
$$
where $\varepsilon$ is a small positive number quantifying the scale of the noise, and \(\sigma\) is a \(2\times 2\) diffusion matrix, which sets how much noise is present at each point in space and time.
The equivalent integral representation of this SDE is 
$$
y_t = x + \int_0^t{u(y_\tau, \tau)\mathrm{d}\tau} + \varepsilon\int_0^t{\sigma(y_\tau, \tau)\mathrm{d}W_\tau}.
$$
