You've probably heard of chaos theory through the butterfly effect; the metaphorical image that a butterfly flapping its wings will cause a tornado several weeks later on the other side of the world. But what does this actually mean mathematically? One way of thinking of chaos is sensitivity to initial conditions. A very small change to the initial state of a system results in a very different outcome. A chaotic system is completely deterministic, but results can seem random and as a result it becomes practically impossible to predict the future behaviour of the system.

Chaos theory came to prominence with the development of the electronic computer, as scientists were able to quickly perform calculations which previously had to be done by hand. Complicated, non-linear systems could be solved automatically. One of the main pioneers of chaos, Edward Lorenz, came across the idea accidental when, in 1961, he was simulating a weather model on a digital computer[^1]. One day, wanting to repeat an interesting sequence of results, Lorenz retyped the numbers into his computer and reran the simulation. However, the results were completely different. Not just off by a little bit, but describing a completely different weather state. The numbers he re-entered were rounded off by just three decimal places, but this was enough to cause the discrepancy. The conditions differed only slightly, but had resulted in completely different outcomes.

This wasn't the first time this type of behaviour had been seen. In biology, simple discrete models[^2] of population would misbehave and jump around seemingly at random. At first, this unexplained behaviour was assumed to be the fault of missing features from the real population.

Key to chaos theory was the realisation that this behaviour is actually a fundamental part of the system, rather than the fault of numeric imprecision. There was no problem with the model, no unexplained factor. Non-linearities were causing nearby points to do bizarre things. This discovery unlocked a whole new area of mathematics which has since been applied to understand turbulence in fluid flow, the stock market, the length of coastlines, road traffic, quantum theory and many other fields.

Chaos is also the reason why long-term weather forecasts are rubbish. The atmosphere is full of so many interacting factors and non-linearities that it's a prime example of a vastly chaotic system. Measurement error will always exist, so accurate predictions of the weather more than a couple of weeks in advanced is fundamentally impossible. Chaos wasn't all doom and gloom for weather forecasting though, and has led to huge improvements in the area. Recognising that measurements are not perfect, forecasters now use ensemble models, averaging across many simulations.

Chaos theory remains a huge area of open research across many disciplines. We are still finding new places to apply it and understand the underlying patterns which cause such dramatic behaviour.
